# American Invaders - A Donald Trump / Space Invaders crossover
#### Created lovingly at DUCS Quckathon 2016 by the team "Ducking Quackers"

This is a twist on the classic space invaders game, featuring President-Elect Trump's famous border wall, and many many immigrants who just won't stop trying to ruin his country...


The base engine for this game was taken from [this tutorial](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/681130/Learn-JavaScript-Part-2-Space-Invaders . It was then adapted to be less politically correct.
